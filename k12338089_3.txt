In this lecture, Professor Martina Seidl talked about the idea that Competitions between SAT (Satisfiability) Solvers could be used as a catalyst for further research and development of more sophisticated Solvers. She went into detail regarding the origins of many SAT Solvers and the criteria that they have to meet to be usable and Competitive. In the case of the former, they have to be able to fulfill their purpose in verifying the satisfiability of logical statements, as well as being intuitive and easy to use, with a dollop of consistency between different Solver programs. As for the latter, Prof. Seidl dedicated the rest of the lecture to point out the benefits that competitions bring to the progression and sophistication of these Solver programs. These contests between different developers provide a need to improve one's Solver and identify the limitations and benchmarks that the field has achieved. They are also a way to archive previous winners and catalog the improvements in design that made a particular Solver victorious in a given category. These contests feed into mankind's natural competitive spirit and desire to out-do others. They are also a way of entertainment for the general public, like a computerized gladiatorial combat.
I believe that the talk was well suited for its intended audience, as 1st Semester students tend to be eager to explore their current field of study and prove their skills to others. I was surprised at just how many of these competitions there are, and how easy it is to sign up to them. I would've thought that you had to be drafted into them by your university for being the best in the class.
