In this lecture, Mr. Stefan Baumgartner went over the topic of Wireless Communications using Machine Learning to allow for "machine-to-machine" communication, such as in the case of automated driving. Mr. Baumgartner went into detail about the intricacies of Wireless Data Transmission, detailing everything from the physical mediums that send and receive signals, to the very model of Data Transmission. He also presented a way of estimation for "data vectors", known as "Model-Based Equalization", and both its ups and downs, such as knowing the reliability of estimates, and optimal methods often being computationally infeasible.
While this approach worked well, it was too "black-box" and its optimal estimator was too complex for what it should've been. To solve this, Stefan presented the SICNN (Self-Interference Cancellation Neural Network), which employed sub-NNs (neural networks) to estimate noise, and mitigated issues of "model-based" methods, like the one I mentioned earlier. However, the NNs were still too complex and needed to be simplified in order to implement hardware. This is still in the works, and solutions are currently being developed by Stefan and his team at the "Institute of Signal Processing".
While I enjoyed the talk, most of the information flew over my head and I got just a basic grasp of the topic. This is likely due to me not being very familiar with the topic, but could also lie with the topic itself. It's quite complex, and to attempt to simplify it would be to omit the main substance of the topic. I don't believe that this topic is well suited to those that are just being introduced to the field of ML (machine learning), as it is mainly built of more complex things that people like me might not understand yet. However, that's not to say that it won't be enjoyed by more advanced students, as it may be a good look at how "machine-to-machine" communication works.
